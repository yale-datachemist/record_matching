# Vector-Enhanced Entity Resolution: Final Solution

## Solution Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive solution for entity resolution in library catalog data that leverages vector embeddings to improve entity disambiguation, particularly for difficult cases like the Franz Schubert example. The solution has been updated to work directly with your specific data format - CSV files where the text columns contain vector-embedded content rather than explicit vector arrays.

## Key Components

1. **VectorEnhancedEntityResolver** (`vector_enhanced_entity_resolution_v2.py`)
   - Core implementation of the entity resolution algorithm
   - Handles vector-embedded text in CSV format
   - Performs domain-aware disambiguation for entities with identical names

2. **Run Script** (`run-vector-enhanced-resolution.py`)
   - Command-line interface for running the entity resolution pipeline
   - Loads entity and vector data
   - Trains the model and evaluates results


4. **Usage Instructions** (`README.md`)
   - Detailed documentation on using the system
   - Explains supported data formats
   - Provides troubleshooting guidance

## Enhanced Features for Vector-Embedded Text

The solution has been specifically adapted to work with your data format:

### 1. Vector Data Loading

```python
def load_vector_data(entity_df, vector_file):
    # ...
    # This is likely a dataset with vector-embedded text in the same columns as the entity dataset
    logging.info("Detected dataset with vector-embedded text in content columns")
    
    # Set ID column as index if found
    if id_col:
        vector_df = vector_df.set_index(id_col)
    
    # Verify this is indeed vector-embedded by checking a few columns
    text_cols = ['person', 'title', 'subjects', 'roles']
    vector_cols = []
    
    # Find columns that appear to contain vector embeddings
    for col in text_cols:
        if col in vector_df.columns:
            sample_val = vector_df[col].iloc[0]
            # Check if this column contains embeddings (non-string data or very long strings)
            if not isinstance(sample_val, str):
                vector_cols.append(col)
            elif isinstance(sample_val, str) and len(sample_val) > 1000:  # Arbitrary threshold
                vector_cols.append(col)
```

### 2. Field-Based Vector Similarity

```python
def calculate_vector_similarity(self, record1_id, record2_id, vector_df, field='context'):
    # Check if both records exist in vector data
    if record1_id not in vector_df.index or record2_id not in vector_df.index:
        return 0.0
    
    # Get embedded vectors based on the format
    vector1 = None
    vector2 = None
    
    # Try to get vectors from the specified field
    try:
        if field in vector_df.columns:
            # Handle the case where text fields have been vectorized
            vector1 = vector_df.loc[record1_id, field]
            vector2 = vector_df.loc[record2_id, field]
            
            # Convert to numpy arrays if needed
            if isinstance(vector1, str):
                # Try to parse as array string
                try:
                    vector1 = np.array(eval(vector1))
                    vector2 = np.array(eval(vector2))
                except:
                    # Not an array string
                    return 0.0
```

### 3. Multi-Field Vector Comparison

```python
# Identify important fields for vector similarity
vector_fields = ['subjects', 'title', 'person'] if has_vectors else []

# Calculate vector similarities for key fields to find candidate pairs
for i, (idx1, id1) in enumerate(vector_records):
    for idx2, id2 in vector_records[i+1:]:
        # Calculate vector similarities for different fields
        field_sims = {}
        for field in vector_fields:
            if field in vector_df.columns:
                sim = self.calculate_vector_similarity(id1, id2, vector_df, field)
                field_sims[field] = sim
```

### 4. Domain-Aware Disambiguation

```python
# Special handling for identical names
if name_sim > 0.9:
    # If names are identical but domains are very different,
    # this is likely a different entity - adjust weighting
    if domain_sim < 0.3:
        # Weights that emphasize domain differences
        weights = {
            'name_sim': 0.2,
            'vector_sim': 0.3 if has_field_vectors else 0.0,
            'context_sim': 0.1,
            'domain_sim': 0.4
        }
```

## How It Fixes the Franz Schubert Problem

The solution correctly disambiguates the Franz Schubert entities by:

1. Detecting that they have identical names
2. Comparing the vector embeddings of their subjects and titles
3. Recognizing the significant domain differences (photography vs. music)
4. Enforcing stricter similarity thresholds for entities with identical names
5. Splitting clusters based on domain coherence

## Running the Solution

To run the solution with your data:

```bash
python run-vector-enhanced-resolution.py --entity-file benchmark_data_records.csv --ground-truth benchmark_data_matches_expanded.csv --vector-file benchmark_data_records_vectorized.csv
```

The system will:
1. Load the entity dataset and ground truth matches
2. Load the vector dataset with embedded text
3. Train the entity resolution model
4. Resolve entities with vector enhancement
5. Output resolved entities and evaluation metrics

## Performance and Advantages

The solution offers several advantages:

1. **Works with your exact data format** - No need to convert or preprocess
2. **Leverages vector embeddings effectively** - Uses vector similarity to improve disambiguation
3. **Generalizable approach** - No domain-specific rules or hardcoded patterns
4. **Robust to missing data** - Functions even with partial vector coverage
5. **Transparent evaluation** - Provides detailed metrics and analysis of difficult cases

This solution successfully addresses the Franz Schubert disambiguation problem and similar cases throughout the library catalog, significantly improving entity resolution quality.
